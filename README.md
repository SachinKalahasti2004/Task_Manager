# Welcome to my Task Manager!
# Built with Streamlit and SQLite, it provides an interface for adding, viewing, updating, and deleting tasks. Each task has a title, description, status (pending or completed), and due time in AM/PM format. Tasks are stored in an SQLite database and displayed in a table sorted by due time.
# Users can update the task status or delete tasks by entering their ID. The app also includes a Productivity Graph, which visually shows the number of pending and completed tasks, helping users track their progress.
# Overall, this app simplifies task management and offers a visual overview of productivity. Here's to making life smoother!
